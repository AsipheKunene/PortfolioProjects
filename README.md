# Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here you'll find a showcase of my data analysis skills, including two key projects:

- **SQL EDA on COVID-19**: This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 data using SQL. I performed data extraction, transformation, and analysis to uncover trends and insights related to the pandemic's impact on various regions and demographics. Take a look at the visualisation [here!](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19CaseStudyDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

- **Excel Pivot Table/Dashboard**: This project features a dynamic pivot table and interactive dashboard created in Excel. It highlights my ability to organize, visualize, and interpret complex datasets, providing actionable insights through intuitive and user-friendly reports.
